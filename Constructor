what is Constructor in python?
Constructor is a special function which is called when an object of class is created.

syntax of constructor:-

def __init__(self):
  #code...
  
  example code:-
   class a:
    def __init__(self):  #self acts as an pointer.
        age =32
        name="my age is"
        print(name,age)
        
obj = a()
        
  
Types of constructors : 

default constructor: The default constructor is a simple constructor which doesnâ€™t accept any arguments. Its definition has only one argument which is a reference to the instance being constructed.

example:

class Constructors:
	# default constructor
	def __init__(self):
		self.name = "Prajwal"

	# a method for printing data members
	def print_name(self):
		print(self.name)


# creating object of the class
obj = Constructors()

# calling the instance method using the object obj
obj.print_name()

parameterized constructor: constructor with parameters is known as parameterized constructor. The parameterized constructor takes its first argument as a reference to the instance being constructed known as self and the rest of the arguments are provided by the programmer.
example:

class Addition:
	first = 0
	second = 0
	answer = 0

	# parameterized constructor
	def __init__(self, f, s):
		self.first = f
		self.second = s

	def display(self):
		print("First number = " + str(self.first))
		print("Second number = " + str(self.second))
		print("Addition of two numbers = " + str(self.answer))

	def calculate(self):
		self.answer = self.first + self.second


# creating object of the class
# this will invoke parameterized constructor
obj1 = Addition(1000, 2000)

# creating second object of same class
obj2 = Addition(10, 20)

# perform Addition on obj1
obj1.calculate()

# perform Addition on obj2
obj2.calculate()

# display result of obj1
obj1.display()

# display result of obj2
obj2.display()
